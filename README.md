Developed on windows but works for Linux and Mac as well<br>
<br>
Purpose -> Imagine a website that an online ATM with works only with cash money.<br>
User inputs his money amount (we can assume that it's dollar $). <br>
This ATM website should give count of moneys for each cash and MINIMUM count of cash.<br>
<br>
Such as; Imagine user inputs 273;<br>
<br>
2 => 100 $ <br>
1 =>  50 $ <br>
1 =>  20 $ <br>
1 =>   2 $ <br>
1 =>   1 $ <br>
<br>
So website should give this output and 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = The total count of cash is 6.<br>
<br>
(Note: Dollar cash moneys are: $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100)<br>
